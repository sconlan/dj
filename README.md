# dj
A lightweight perl mp3 manager for OS X

# intro

I was looking for a lightweight way to manage a large library of music files. the dj.pl script currently takes a single argument, a directory of music files, and plays them via afplay (available on OS X). It also calls afinfo to grab track lengths. That's it.
